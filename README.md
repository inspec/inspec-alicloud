# InSpec for AliCloud


* **[Project State](https://github.com/chef/chef-oss-practices/blob/master/repo-management/repo-states.md): Prototyping**

This InSpec resource pack uses the AliCloud SDK v0.8.0 and provides the required resources to write tests for resources in AliCloud.

## Prerequisites

### AliCloud Credentials

Valid AliCloud credentials are required.

#### Environment Variables

Set your AliCloud credentials in an `.envrc` file or export them in your shell. (See example [.envrc file](.envrc_example))
    
```bash
    # Example configuration
    export ALICLOUD_ACCESS_KEY="anaccesskey"
    export ALICLOUD_SECRET_KEY="asecretkey"
    export ALICLOUD_REGION="eu-west-1"
```

## Resources
This resource pack allows the testing of the following AliCloud resources. If a resource you wish to test is not listed, please feel free to open an [Issue](https://github.com/chef-customers/inspec-alicloud/issues). As an open source project, we also welcome public contributions via [Pull Request](https://github.com/chef-customers/inspec-alicloud/pulls).

## Environment and Setup Notes

#### Train and InSpec Dependencies

InSpec AliCloud depends on version 0.0.4 of the AliCloud SDK that is provided via [Train AliCloud](https://github.com/chef-customers/train-alicloud). InSpec does not ship with Train AliCloud so this is explicitly listed in the Gemfile here.

### Running the unit and integration tests

Run the linting ~and unit tests~ via the below:
```
$ bundle exec rake
Running RuboCop...
Inspecting 16 files
................

16 files inspected, no offenses detected
```

To keep things simple the AliCloud credentials can either be supplied via environmental variables.

Running the integration tests requires resources so first `setup_integration_tests` which uses Terraform:
```
$ bundle exec rake test:setup_integration_tests
----> Initializing Terraform
terraform init

Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
----> Generating Terraform and InSpec variable files
----> Generating the Plan
terraform plan -var-file=inspec-alicloud.tfvars.json -out inspec-alicloud.plan
...
This plan was saved to: inspec-alicloud.plan

To perform exactly these actions, run the following command to apply:
    terraform apply "inspec-alicloud.plan"

----> Applying the plan
terraform apply inspec-alicloud.plan
...
Apply complete! Resources: 24 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```

Next, run the integration tests themselves with `run_integration_tests`
```
$ bundle exec rake test:run_integration_tests
----> Running InSpec tests
bundle exec inspec exec test/integration/verify -t alicloud:// --input-file test/integration/build/alicloud-inspec-attributes.yaml --reporter cli json:inspec-output.json html:inspec-output.html --chef-license=accept-silent; rc=$?; if [ $rc -eq 0 ] || [ $rc -eq 101 ]; then exit 0; else exit 1; fi
