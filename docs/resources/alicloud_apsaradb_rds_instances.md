# alicloud\_apsaradb\_rds\_instances

Use the `alicloud_apsaradb_rds_instances` InSpec audit resource to test properties of a collection of ApsaraDB RDS instances.

ApsaraDB RDS supports the MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, PPAS (highly compatible with Oracle) and MariaDB database engines.

## Syntax

 Ensure you have exactly 3 instances

    describe alicloud_apsaradb_rds_instances do
      its('db_instance_ids.count') { should cmp 3 }
    end

#### Parameters

This resource does not expect any parameters.

See also the [Alicloud documentation on ApsaraDB RDS](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/26092.htm).

## Examples

##### Ensure a specific instance exists

    describe alicloud_apsaradb_rds_instances do
      its('db_instance_ids') { should include 'rm-a1b2c3d4e5f6' }
    end

##### Use the InSpec resource to request the IDs of all ApsaraDB RDS instances, then test in-depth using `alicloud_apsaradb_rds_instance` to ensure all instances have the expected network security settings.

    alicloud_apsaradb_rds_instances.db_instance_ids.each do |db_instance_id|
      describe alicloud_apsaradb_rds_instance(db_instance_id) do
        its('in_default_vpc') { should be false }
        its('security_ips') { should_not cmp '' }
        its('security_ips') { should_not include '0.0.0.0/0' }
      end
    end

## Matchers

For a full list of available matchers, please visit our [Universal Matchers page](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/matchers/).

#### exist

The control will pass if the describe returns at least one result.

    describe alicloud_apsaradb_rds_instances do
      it { should exist }
    end

Use `should_not` to test the entity should not exist.

    describe alicloud_apsaradb_rds_instances do
      it { should_not exist }
    end

## Alicloud Permissions

Your Principal will need the `rds:DescribeDBInstances` action with Effect set to Allow.
